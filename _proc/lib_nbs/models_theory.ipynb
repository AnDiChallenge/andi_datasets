    "This class contains a recopilatory of diffusion models used in ANDI. The class\n",

    "| Function |  Dimensions   | Description|\n",
    "|-------|-------|-------|\n",
    "| bm  | (1D) | Brownian motion|\n",
    "| fbm | (1D/2D/3D) | Fractional browian motion, simulated via the `stochastic` Python library|\n",
    "| ctrw | (1D/2D/3D) | Continuous time random walks|\n",
    "| lw | (1D/2D/3D) | Levy walks|\n",

    "\n",
    "- For every model in the previous list, there exists a function `models_theory.name_walk` which generates diffusion following that model. All functions have the same inputs and outputs:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    **Inputs**  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - `T` (`int`): lenght of the trajectory. Gets transformed to int if input is float.\n",
    "    - `alpha` (`float`): anomalous exponent\n",
    "    - `D` (`{1,2,3}`): dimension of the walk.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Outputs**\n",

    "    \n",
    "    This is the recommended way of generating trajectories.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- For every dimension, there exists a subclass `models_theory._dimensionD`, which gives access to the walk generators in each dimensions. Every walk is a function of these subclasses. This allows to access more features of the diffusion models:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `ctrw`\n",
    "        -  `regular_time` (`bool`): if true, regularizes the trajectory so that every element in the output corresponds to a time step. If false, returns the positions and times at which steps were done.\n",
    "    - `attm`:\n",
    "        - `regime` (`{1,2,3}`): allows to chose the regime of ATTM model. See the original paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 150603 (2014)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.150603) for further details.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - `sbm`:\n",
    "        - `sigma` (`float`): variance of the noise generator (similar to a local diffusion coefficient).\n",
