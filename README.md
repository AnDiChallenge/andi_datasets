This library has been created in the framework of the [**Anomalous
Diffusion (AnDi) Challenge**](http://andi-challenge.org/) and allows to
create trajectories and datasets from various anomalous diffusion
models. Learn all the details and discover the available tutorials in the [**library webpage**](https://andichallenge.github.io/andi_datasets/)

## Installation

You can install the package using:

``` python
pip install andi-datasets
```

You can then import the package in a Python3 environment using:

``` python
import andi_datasets
```

## Contributing

The AnDi challenge is a community effort, hence any contribution to this
library is more than welcome. If you think we should include a new model
to the library, you can contact us in this mail:
andi.challenge@gmail.com. You can also perform pull-requests and open
issues with any feedback or comments you may have.

## Requirements

All current requirements are declared in the file `setting.ini`.

Further details can be found at the [PYPI package
webpage](https://pypi.org/project/andi-datasets/).
